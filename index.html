        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Awoyinka Opeyemi Oyeniyi</p>
        <p>Once again my names are Awoyinka Opeyemi Oyeniyi, i am 26yrs old born in the month of May 1 1998. I am from Kwara state, a western state in Nigeria. <br>
            I am from the family of 6. I am the first child while i have 3 siblings right behind me. My household is a Christian home and we live in harmony with the right doctrine to be a better person in the society, these are the moral lessons my parents has brought me and my siblings up with.
        <br> I lost my father April 26, 2023. And this incident has shaped me to be the figure i am today. I am more of an indoor person, i love to spend quality time alone and to keep to myself, however, i love to be in the presence of the Lord in church most especially in the praises session. I love listening to good Music.</p>
        <span>I am a B'sc and B'ed holder. I attended the No. 1 testiary university in Ogun state Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijebu-ode, Ogun state. I graduated with a 2.1 upper in English studies. Before these, i had a primary education and secondary education in one of the best schools in Lagos state.
            <br>I currently work as a Clearing agent in Nigeria Sea Port located in Apapa Lagos. However, i am currently on the moving train to transitioning into the tech space and i love my screen time with my gadgets and i have chosen sides with the <strong>Front-End Engineering</strong> in Software Developing.
            <br>I have a creative mind in art and design as i was a art student in my secondary level of education and i will be able to create an attractive interface for users to be able to work with easily at the end of my professional programme in tech.
        </span>

        <p>I have some couple of favourite things i like to do such as:
            <ul>
                <li>I like to spend time on the screen of my devices</li>
                <li>I like to eat a lot</li>
                <li>I take my sleep seriously</li>
                <li>I listen to good music</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>I go by many belief as long as it suits the mouth that it comes out from. People tend to descirbe me from their point of view which at some point i agree with them as long as it brings peace to the atmosphere. I have a major trait of doing my best and not leaving the rest until all assignments gets done. I have the zeal to bring out the hidden potential in me and be the best version of myself for myself and those around me.</p>

            <article>Altschool Africa has distinguished itself among every other tech academy, altschool has gained more accredition in african contries and overseas with a proof of testament to back this achivements. I have personally seen and heard testimonies from various tech expert who has gone through the magic wand of teaching in altschool and this teachings shouldn't pass me by. The accreditions in which altschool africa has acquired as made it's certificate most acceptable by all firms in need of new recruits. Altschool Africa is the real place to be.</article>
            <article>However, Altschool Africa have a mode of mentorship that helps keeps students on track even after the duration of the learning programme, and this is huge for me as we know it is not really about how you start but the continuity that comes with it and gives you a good finish.</article>
